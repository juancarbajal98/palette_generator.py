# palette_generator.py
Python GUI that takes a file name from a user for an existing jpg image. After entering file name, user is prompted with the image alongside a grid of white squares vertically or horizontally aligned a side of the image, depending on specified orientation. The user can click anywhere on the image and capture the color clicked on inside of one of the white squares. 
Once the grid is filled the resulting jpg is saved.
